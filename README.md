# Choo-ban
Just a simple kanban :)

## Demo
http://choo-ban.surge.sh

## Stack
> Basically I decided to not use any boilerplate for this project. To use choo with ES6 imports I took webpack, and to help the development process I used webpack-dev-server. Basically that's it.

### Libs

#### Production
| Lib        | Reason           |
| ------------- |-------------|
| choo | Simple frontend framework  |
| nanocomponent | Simple lib to work with components in choo.js |
| materialize | UI framework |
| sweetalert | Simple and beautiful popup boxes |

#### Development
| Lib        | Reason           |
| ------------- |-------------|
| webpack | ES6 Module imports and simplicity |
| webpack-dev-server | I just love webpack-dev-server, it's simple and very useful |
| babel | Code transpilation and compatibility between browsers |

## Running locally
After downloading (or cloning) this repo, just run:
```
yarn
yarn start
```
_This will start the project locally on port 3000 and open a tab in your browser automatically._
